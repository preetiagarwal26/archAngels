Existing system : https://github.com/ldynia/archcolider 

## Overview 

The following component diagram shows the new components added to [archcollider's system](https://github.com/ldynia/archcolider/blob/4a71575e64fb4e28a284f3bc063169ce7082668c/img/FF_system_approach.png).
The main purpose of extending archcollider's original component diagram is to ease understanding and give an overall picture of how our new components fit into the existing solution.
